# cvs-customer-assistance-buttons-sdr
This repository houses the work that ive put into reversing the various encoders and protocols used for customer service buttons in retail shops such as Walgreens, CVS, Lowes, and Home Depot

Each retailer is broken out into it's own folder, and within that folder are the CU8 sdr signals as well as a folder for the FlipperZero subghz sub captures.

Please clone this repository or include it as a submodule in your repository if you link to it.
